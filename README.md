# MyBeer-Android

## Introduction
MyBeer was created like a application was used for the management of breweries and beers by the user, with the determination to be able to locate the data on a map and be able to save the information of said elements so that the user can access them whenever they want.


## Documentation
The main functionality of the application consists of three modules (Main, Breweries and Beers), which are accessible through a side menu. This menu can be accessed by clicking on the upper left button of the interface or by sliding your finger from the left side of the screen to the right side.

### Main Module
The main module consists of a map that will show us our geolocation, as well as the breweries located in their respective locations.

Breweries can be displayed in different colors according to their status. In addition to clicking on a brewery, its name will appear, and finally, in the lower right we can the floating button will automatically redirect us to our position on the map.

### Breweries Modules
The module "breweries" has two main functionalities: add a new brewery and list the breweries that the user has saved. In addition, clicking on each of the listed breweries will redirect us to a view where we can appreciate the information of the brewery in more detail.

## Architecture
- **Presentation layer**: represented by the activities package, it is responsible for rendering the views. This layer, although not responsible for the logic of the application, does perform small validations that are closely linked to the input format.

- **Business layer**: formed by the services of the application, it is located in the model package. In this layer, all the logic of the application takes place, in charge of complying with the business rules necessary for its proper functioning.

- **Integration layer**: layer responsible for communicating with the mobile device for reading and writing the data necessary for the application to develop correctly. Implemented by the FileManager class.
