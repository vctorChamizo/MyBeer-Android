## Architecture
- **Presentation layer**: represented by the activities package, it is responsible for rendering the views. This layer, although not responsible for the logic of the application, does perform small validations that are closely linked to the input format.

- **Business layer**: formed by the services of the application, it is located in the model package. In this layer, all the logic of the application takes place, in charge of complying with the business rules necessary for its proper functioning.

- **Integration layer**: layer responsible for communicating with the mobile device for reading and writing the data necessary for the application to develop correctly. Implemented by the FileManager class.
